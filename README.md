# challenge-openspace-classifier

***Description:***

Welcome to the Openspace Classifier project! Our company recently moved to a new office 
with an open space layout consisting of 6 tables, each with 4 seats, making a total of 24 seats. 
To help colleagues get to know each other better, we decided to reassign seats every day. 
This program automates the daily re-assignment of seats, ensuring a random and fair distribution.

***Features:***

	•	Load a list of colleagues from an Excel file.
	•	Randomly distribute people among the available tables and seats.
	•	Display the seating arrangement.
	•	Handle cases where there are more people than seats.

***Contributors:***

	•	Team Member 1 - Mehmet
	•	Team Member 2 - Alisher
	•	Team Member 3 – Zaidoon
	•	Team Member 4 – Zaidoon

***Timeline:***

	•	Day 1: Project setup and class development, integration.
	•	Day 2: Testing, debugging, and final touches.

***Personal Situation:***

This project was developed as a team effort to enhance our skills in Python and project management. 
We collaborated using a Trello board for task management and GitHub for version control.


***Usage:***

Ensure you have an Excel file with a list of colleagues.
Run the main.py script with the filepath to the Excel file as an argument to organize 
and display the seating arrangement.

python main.py --file path/to/colleagues.xlsx
